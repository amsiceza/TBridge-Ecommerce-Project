# Ecommerce API üì∫
An ecommerce API where you can create, update, delete, and search products, categories, and orders, as well as register and authenticate users. Users can also be assigned roles and permissions, and reviews can be added to products.

## Requirements üìã
### Products üì¶
* Endpoint to create a product
```
localhost:3000/products/create
```
* Endpoint to update a product
```
localhost:3000/products/updateById/id
```
* Endpoint to delete a product
```
localhost:3000/products/deleteById/id
```
* The endpoint to fetch products should also display the category or categories it belongs to.
```
localhost:3000/products/getAllProducts
```

* Endpoint to fetch a product by id
```
localhost:3000/products/getById/id
```
* Filter to search for a product by name
```
localhost:3000/products/getByName/name
```
* Filter to search for a product by price
```
localhost:3000/products/getByPrice/price
```
* Filter to order products from highest to lowest price
```
localhost:3000/products/orderDesc
```

* Implement validation when creating a product to ensure that all fields are filled in, and return a message if not.

* You can only create, update, and delete products if you are authenticated.
